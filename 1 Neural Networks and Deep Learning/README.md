# COURSE 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## About the Course
If you want to break into cutting-edge AI, this course will help you do so. Deep learning engineers are highly sought after, and mastering deep learning will give you numerous new career opportunities. Deep learning is also a new "superpower" that will let you build AI systems that just weren't possible a few years ago. 

In this course, you will learn the foundations of deep learning. When you finish this class, you will:
- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
- Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks 
- Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture 

This course also teaches you how Deep Learning actually works, rather than presenting only a cursory or surface-level description. So after completing it, you will be able to apply deep learning to a your own applications. If you are looking for a job in AI, after this course you will also be able to answer basic interview questions. 

This is the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization.

### WEEK 1
#### Introduction to deep learning
Be able to explain the major trends driving the rise of deep learning, and understand where and how it is applied today.

### WEEK 2
#### Neural Networks Basics
Learn to set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset. Learn to use vectorization to speed up your models.

### WEEK 3
#### Shallow neural networks
Learn to build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.

### WEEK 4
#### Deep Neural Networks
Understand the key computations underlying deep learning, use them to build and train deep neural networks, and apply it to computer vision.
